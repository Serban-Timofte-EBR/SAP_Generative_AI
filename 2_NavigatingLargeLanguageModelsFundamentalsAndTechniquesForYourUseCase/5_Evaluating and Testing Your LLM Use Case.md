# Evaluating and Testing Your LLM Use Case

## 1 Methods and Metrics for Model Evaluation

---

To properly evaluate an LLM use case, multiple metrics are used to assess the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the model outputs.

Here is a detailed list of common evaluation metrics:

---

### 1. Perplexity

- **Definition**: Measures how well a language model predicts a given sequence of words.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Lower perplexity = better model performance (better prediction capability).
- **Example**:  
  If a model has a perplexity of 10, it means that on average, it is as uncertain as if it had to choose among 10 possible words at each step.

---

### 2. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)

- **Definition**:  
  Measures the quality of machine-generated text (e.g., translations) by comparing it to a reference human translation.
- **How it works**:  
  - It computes precision over n-grams (sequences of 1 to 4 consecutive words).
- **Example**:
  - For a machine translation system, BLEU score close to 1 indicates a very close match to the human translation.
- **Use Case**:
  - Translation tasks
  - Comparing machine-generated summaries with human-written summaries.

---

### 3. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)

- **Definition**:  
  Evaluates the quality of automatic text summarization.
- **How it works**:  
  - Measures overlap (recall) between machine-generated summaries and reference summaries.
- **Example**:
  - If a generated summary captures 80% of the important points from a human-written summary, it will have a high ROUGE score.

---

### 4. Classification Accuracy

- **Definition**:  
  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total number of predictions.
- **Example**:
  - In a task where the LLM classifies customer reviews as "Positive" or "Negative", an accuracy of 90% means 9 out of 10 reviews were classified correctly.

---

### 5. Precision and Recall

- **Precision**:
  - Definition: Of all predicted positive instances, how many were actually positive?
  - Goal: **Minimize false positives**.
- **Recall**:
  - Definition: Of all actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly predict?
  - Goal: **Minimize false negatives**.
- **Example**:
  - For a spam filter:
    - Precision tells you: Out of all emails flagged as spam, how many were actually spam.
    - Recall tells you: Out of all spam emails, how many were caught by the system.

---

### 6. F1 Score

- **Definition**:  
  The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
- **Why important**:  
  - It balances false positives and false negatives.
- **Example**:
  - Useful in text classification tasks where both precision and recall are important (e.g., identifying toxic comments).

---

### 7. Word Error Rate (WER)

- **Definition**:  
  Measures the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.
- **How it works**:  
  - Compares the generated transcription to a human-transcribed reference.
- **Example**:
  - If a system produces 5 incorrect words out of 100, the WER is 5%.

---

### 8. Semantic Similarity Metrics

- **Definition**:  
  Measures how semantically similar two sentences or documents are.
- **Common Techniques**:
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Compares the angle between two vectorized texts.
  - **Jaccard Index**: Compares common words to total unique words.
  - **Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD)**: Measures how much "effort" is needed to transform one sentence into another.
- **Example**:
  - When checking if a generated answer conveys the same meaning as a human-written answer, even if the words are different.

## 2. Best Practices for LLM Applications

---

### 2.1 Use Model Inference

---

- Model Inference = stage where a trained LLM is deployed into production for making predictions on real-world data.

- During inference, new input text, documents, or queries are fed into the LLM API. This could be customer conversations, product descriptions, legal contracts, and so on, based on the business use case.

### 2.2 Best Practices

1. Fine-tune on domain-specific data: Pretrain LLMs further on relevant industry or company data like customer support tickets, legal contracts, and others. This enhances accuracy on business terminology.

2. Incrementally update training data: Add new product specifications, policy documents, and so on, to continually fine-tune LLMs to maintain performance as new data comes in.

3. Test with production workloads: Evaluate LLMs with real customer queries, transactions, and others instead of synthetic data to measure production readiness.

4. Set rigorous quality metrics: Define quantitative KPIs like accuracy, latency, explanation capability to benchmark model performance.

5. Monitor and address errors: Log model failures during inference to identify areas of improvement and feedback into the next training iteration.

6. Optimize infrastructure costs: Consider infrastructure, for example virtual machine service, or configurations used for training. Model the inference based on efficiency testing to reduce overprovisioning.

7. Failover policies for downtime: Create a backup configuration and redundancy for mission-critical LLM applications to ensure 24/7 availability.

8. Leverage MLOps: Standardize benchmarking, model retraining releases for maintainability, and reproducibility of LLM systems over time.

### 2.3 Leverage MLOps for Testing and Evaluating LLMs Use Case

- MLOps plays the integral role in systematically testing and evaluating LLM performance for the usecase througH:

1. Automated Benchmarking - MLOps pipelines enable running a diverse set of test cases through CI/CD to benchmark capabilities like accuracy, latency, and explainability across different models, versions, and code changes.

2. Centralized Performance Logging - All evaluation metrics during training, validation, and inference are logged in an aggregated manner for analysis and model comparison.

3. Smoother Retraining Setups - Old model versions can be retrained using updated datasets in a reproducible way to measure performance improvements.

4. Error Analysis at Scale - Logs from all running instances are funneled to identify systematic gaps for models to address via feedback loops or architecture tweaks.

5. Gradual Rollouts - Models are first served to a small percentage of traffic to test stability before rollout to higher production volumes in a safe manner.

6. Automated Alerting - Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ElasticSearch, Kibana allows setting alerts on metrics deviations
