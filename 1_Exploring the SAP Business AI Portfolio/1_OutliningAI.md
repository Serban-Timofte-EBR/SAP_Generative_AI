## 2. Summarizing AI

---

### 2.1 AI Overview

---

> At SAP, we firmly believe that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people and software work togheter and we are excited about the opportunities this brings

---

### 2.2 Key Terms in Artificial Intelligence

---

1. Artificia Intelligence (AI)
    - technology that equips machines with human-like capabilities such as problem-solving, visual perception, etc.
    - seen in everyday applications like AI assistants and facial recognition software

2. Machine Learning (ML)
    - the subset of AI that focusses on enabling computer systems to learn and improve from experience (data)

3. Deep Learning
    - branch of ML that uses multi-layered neuronal networks to analyze complex data patterns
    - may employ differenct learning methods like supervised, unsupervesed and reinforce learning depending upon the task and available data.

4. Generative AI (GenAI)
    - form of deep learning which utilizes foundation models (LLMs) to create new content

5. Foundation Models
    - AI systems that can use self-supervides leanrning on vast data to perform variety of tasks

6. Large Language Models (LLMs)
    - subcategory of foundation models that are used for text and computer code.

### 2.3 What is Re-Capped AI

---

**Re-Capped AI** refers to the process of **refining and optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs)** by applying techniques such as:

- **Prompt Engineering**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Fine-Tuning**
- **Agent-based orchestration**

The goal of Re-Capped AI is to **bridge the gap** between a general-purpose pretrained LLM and the **specific requirements of a business application**, ensuring:

- Higher relevance to domain-specific tasks
- Improved model performance and stability
- Lower risks of hallucination, bias, or outdated information
- Efficient interaction with external systems (data retrieval, validation)

---

### Key Characteristics of Re-Capped AI

- **Customization**: Tailoring LLM behavior without completely retraining the base model.
- **Optimization**: Using retrieval or fine-tuning to correct weaknesses or enhance capabilities.
- **Governance**: Ensuring the AI model outputs are ethical, compliant, and business-appropriate.

### Example

A retail company uses a general-purpose LLM for customer support.  
Through Re-Capped AI:

- They fine-tune the model on their specific product catalog.
- They integrate a retrieval system connected to live inventory data.
- They orchestrate responses using agents that ensure regulatory compliance.

Result:  
The AI system delivers **more accurate, relevant, and trustworthy** answers, fully adapted to the retail company's needs.
