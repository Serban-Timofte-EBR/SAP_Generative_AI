## 2. Outlining SAP Business AI Integration into Cloud

- Modern AI relies on large, pre-trained models that run on scalable cloud infrastructure like GPUs.

### 2.1 Embedded AI

---

**Embedded AI** refers to **artificial intelligence capabilities that are built directly into enterprise applications**.

Rather than using external AI systems, Embedded AI runs **natively inside business processes**, allowing users to benefit from AI without leaving their workflows.

---

### Key Characteristics

- **Seamless Integration**:  
  AI features (like recommendations, predictions, and automation) are embedded within standard SAP applications such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP Customer Experience.

- **Business Context Awareness**:  
  Embedded AI leverages **live business data** and **organizational context** to deliver relevant and accurate insights.

- **Real-time Processing**:  
  Insights and recommendations are delivered **immediately** within business processes, improving user decisions and operational efficiency.

### Example

In SAP SuccessFactors, an **Embedded AI** system can automatically suggest **job descriptions** or **interview questions** based on company data — directly inside the recruiter’s workflow, without needing external AI tools.

---

### Summary

- **Embedded AI** = AI inside your SAP applications.  
- It enables smarter business processes by combining real-time data, business context, and AI models, all without disrupting user experience.
