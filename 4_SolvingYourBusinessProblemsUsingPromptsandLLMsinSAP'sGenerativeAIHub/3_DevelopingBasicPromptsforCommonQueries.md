**Solving the Problem:**

1. Develop basic prompt

We'll start with a basic prompt and then develop the prompt, finding an output that can be used by application within the company.

The first prompt is:

```python
Giving the following message:
---
Subject: Urgent HVAC System Repair Needed

Dear Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Sender], and I am reaching out to you from [Residential Complex Name], where I have been residing for the past few years. I have always appreciated the meticulous care and attention your team provides in maintaining our facilities.

However, I am currently facing a pressing issue with the HVAC system in my apartment. Over the past few days, the system has been malfunctioning, resulting in inconsistent temperatures and, at times, complete shutdowns. Given the current weather conditions, this has become quite unbearable and is affecting my daily routine significantly.

I have attempted to troubleshoot the problem by resetting the system and checking the thermostat settings, but these efforts have not yielded any improvement. The situation seems to be beyond my control and requires professional intervention.

I kindly request that a repair team be dispatched immediately to address this urgent issue. The urgency of the matter cannot be overstated, as it is impacting not only my comfort but also my ability to carry out daily activities effectively.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response and resolution.

Best regards,
[Sender]

Your task is to extract:
- "urgency" as one of `low`, `medium`, `high`
- "sentiment" as one of `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`
```

3. Generate JSON output

We need the output of these values in a format that can be used as an input for a software. We decide to use the JSON output.

JSON offers a simple, language-independent, and lightweight solution for efficient data exchange. It can handle complex structures while remaining easy to parse and generate. JSON's widespread use in APIs and web services ensures interoperability, reduces bandwidth and storage requirements, and simplifies the development process.
